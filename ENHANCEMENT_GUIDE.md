## üéØ **Quick Start Guide:**

### **Step 1: Choose a File to Enhance**
Start with the area you're most interested in or have an interview coming up for.

### **Step 2: For Each Question, Add These Sections:**

**Before the existing code:**
```markdown
**üéØ Core Concepts & Theory:**
[Fundamental concepts explanation]

**Why This Approach?**
[Business justification and technical reasoning]
```

**Within the code:**
```typescript
// CONCEPT: [Pattern/principle name]
// WHY: [Explanation of why this code exists]
// HOW: [Step-by-step breakdown]
const example = "code";
```

**After the code:**
```markdown
**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns Used:**
